Hey 👋
My name is Ruben Munoz and I'm a Colombian mechanical engineer which is currently enrolling in the software and web development world. I'm currently studying at HENRY, which is an Argentinian bootcamp for people that is eager to help build the Internet.

Besides web development, I'm also studying Agribusiness in Brandon, Manitoba (Canada) where I'm currently located. I'm really interested and have experience in entrepreneurship and business. I'm currently aiming to expand my knowledge and experience in the agriculture 🌽 and software 💻 fields, which I recognize as the most influential for the humanity in the years to come.

About my hobbies, I love playing videogames 🎮, hanging out with my friends and family 🍻, and taking care of my cats and dogs 🐱🐶.
